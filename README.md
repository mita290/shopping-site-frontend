# 🛍️ Shopping Site Frontend

This is a simple and interactive shopping site frontend built with **React** and **Vite**, allowing users to browse a list of products and manage a shopping cart. What makes this project unique is the integration of **voice commands** using `react-speech-recognition`, allowing users to add and remove items from the cart hands-free!
